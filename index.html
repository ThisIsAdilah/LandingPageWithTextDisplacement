          Quantum is at an inflection point. Building scalable quantum technology is the most important
           technical problem of our time. We are dedicated to this goal, with a single focus: to make
            quantum systems that are both useful and scalable.
                  
          Our founding team is comprised quantum physicists from MIT and
           industry engineering leaders. We're assembling a lean, world-class team of engineers, 
           researchers and technologists. If you're passionate about quantum and want to work on the 
           most important challenge of our age, contact us.
